## Notes

### Development

- `ctrl + Q`: show docs for symbol under cursor
- `ctrl + K`: VCS (git) commit dialog
- `ctrl` + `[`/`]`: move to opening/closing bracket of current block
- `ctrl` + `-`/`+`: collapse/expand current code block
- `ctrl` + `shift` + `-`/`+`: collapse/expand all code blocks

#### Useful rust smart templates

- `tmod`+`<TAB>`: generate test module
- `tfn`+`<TAB>`: generate test function

### Testing

- First, install: `cargo install cargo-watch`
- Then, from the project's root directory run `cargo watch -x test` to automatically rerun all tests on save.

## TODO

- in Rust, can we make Vector/Point types that "inherit" from tuple but only implement relevant operations on each one?
- Learn how to split projects into crates that are part of a
  workspace https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch14-03-cargo-workspaces.html
- Can we generate the operators for Color in terms of Tuple automatically, using a macro?
    - this would make any other extensions of Tuple easier to write since they could all just define a from/to tuple
      conversion and then all operators can delegate to underlying tuple implementations.
